# PHP Best Practices Skill Created

✅ Skill has been created following the Vercel skills.sh pattern.
✅ Based on TiendaNube PHP Programming Best Practices document.

## What was built:

1. **SKILL.md** - Main skill documentation with 45+ rules across 7 categories
2. **README.md** - Overview and usage instructions
3. **scripts/analyze-php-code.sh** - Analysis script for PHP code
4. **examples/** - Good and bad code examples with tests
   - GoodProduct.php - Demonstrates best practices
   - BadProduct.php - Shows common anti-patterns
   - ProductTest.php - Example tests following best practices

## Skill Structure:

The skill follows Vercel's skills.sh format with:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Organized rule categories (Naming, Variables, SOLID, Methods, etc.)
- Concrete code examples for each rule
- Practical scripts for automation
- Comprehensive examples directory

## Next Steps:

✅ **Skill Deployed to GitHub:** https://github.com/developerfred/php-best-practices-skill
✅ **Ready for skills.sh:** Use `npx skills add developerfred/php-best-practices-skill`

## Skill Discovery:

The skill should appear on skills.sh over time as it gets installations. As people install it,
it will rank on the skills.sh leaderboard based on anonymous telemetry data.

## Further Development:

1. Add more PHP framework-specific rules (Laravel, Symfony, etc.)
2. Create more specialized examples
3. Add GitHub Actions for automated testing
4. Create documentation website
