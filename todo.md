# PHP Best Practices Skill Created

✅ Skill has been created following the Vercel skills.sh pattern.
✅ Based on TiendaNube PHP Programming Best Practices document.

## What was built:

1. **SKILL.md** - Main skill documentation with 45+ rules across 7 categories
2. **README.md** - Overview and usage instructions
3. **scripts/analyze-php-code.sh** - Analysis script for PHP code
4. **examples/** - Good and bad code examples with tests
   - GoodProduct.php - Demonstrates best practices
   - BadProduct.php - Shows common anti-patterns
   - ProductTest.php - Example tests following best practices

## Skill Structure:

The skill follows Vercel's skills.sh format with:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Organized rule categories (Naming, Variables, SOLID, Methods, etc.)
- Concrete code examples for each rule
- Practical scripts for automation
- Comprehensive examples directory

## Next Steps:

1. Publish to skills.sh if desired
2. Use with AI agents for PHP code review/generation
3. Extend with more specific PHP framework rules (Laravel, Symfony, etc.)
